# streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]

# As soon as you run the script as shown above, a local Streamlit server
# will spin up and your app will open in a new tab in your default web browser.
# The app is your canvas, where you'll draw charts, text, widgets, tables, and more.
# What gets drawn in the app is up to you. For example 
# 
# st.text writes raw text to your # app, and 
# st.line_chart draws — you guessed it — a line chart. Refer to our API documentation

# to see all commands that are available to you.
